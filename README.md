# Titanic Decision Tree (a Christmas break project)

I used the Titanic data set on Kaggle.com as a test data set for implementing a decision tree from scratch using Java.  The purpose of this project was to practice using Java and to become more familiar with the details of the decision tree learning algorithm.

TreeDemo.java grows the tree.  It requires the file train.csv https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data, with the header removed.

TestTreeDemo.java uses the model built by TreeDemo.java to classify new observations.  It requires the file test.csv from the same site on Kaggle (also with the header removed).  To run TestTreeDemo, use the model as the first argument and the submission file as the second argument.
